Comparing returns from 2017 and 2018, every tracked stock (other than TERP and RUN) either gained less or lost money in 2018 when compared to 2017. TERP lost less money in 2018 than in 2017 and RUN grew 80%. ENPH and RUN were the only tracked stocks with positive returns for 2018.

The following stocks experienced an increase in trade volume from 2017 to 2018: DQ, ENPH, HASI, RUN, SEDG, TERP, and VSLR.  It is worth noting that DQ, ENPH, and RUN all experienced significant proportional increases to their trade volume from 2017 to 2018.  ENPH and RUN were the only stocks that saw positive returns in 2018.  DQ does not fit this pattern but its total volume numbers are less than half of those of ENPH and RUN.  Data for the charts above follows.
